        <li>introduction</li>

<p>Food is a constant that often has great cultural significance. Especially in recent times, food has become a prominent element of pop culture that has become a popular trend. On the flip side, this has only exacerbated the indecision that comes with choosing what to eat. This can be distressing when you are already hungry and unfamiliar with the geographical location you're currently in. With our visualization tool, we want to address the average user who often just needs to find a restaurant that is relatively good quality, close by, and not too overloaded with orders. By preventing information overload and streamlining the visualizations to include these main points, users can make informed food decisions more quickly. </p>
        <li>domain task</li>
         <p>1. identify food options that are geographically accessible</p>
         <p>2. allow users to prioritize restaurant popularity or quality</p>
         <p>3. quickly assess what recent customer sentiment for a restaurant has been</p>
         <p>4. make the most informed decision to purchase takeout in the most time efficient way</p>

         <li><p>The goal end user is someone like a college student who lives in a dorm. This user is under immense stress, but does not have the means to cook for themselves and likely unfamiliar with their surroundings. To create the visualization tool for these end users, we will be cleaning data from a subset of the Yelp dataset to fit project parameters.</p> </li>

         <li>user case</li>
         <p>say you’ve just moved to a UC Santa Barbara dorm and don’t have any means to cook. You look up “take out restaurants” on popular search tools like Google or Yelp, but you are tired and overwhelmed. Using our tool, the user enters their current location, current time and preferred mile radius. All Santa Barbara restaurants within that range that are currently open are displayed on a mini map, along with the current location. Each restaurant also lists the name, rating, number of reviews, and the distance to the restaurant. When a restaurant is clicked, a bar chart shows on the side showing the distribution of all reviews by star rating, with each category labelled with the date of the most recent review. The user can either use the map to browse what is located next to each other, or use the bar chart to identify recent sentiments about that restaurant. The two visualizations allow the user to choose whether they prioritize distance, rating, or popularity without having to step foot into the restaurant.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <!-- TODO: Add link to report, demo video, link to data etc. here   -->
        <p>
        Our data set is taken from Yelp, and is a compilation of businesses and reviews that Yelp put out for public use. A link to the data set can be found at (https://www.yelp.com/dataset). This data was not what we originally expected, as it did not contain data from all cities but only a small sample of cities. However, in the cities it did include, a wide variety of restaurants and other businesses were selected. For our purposes, we chose only locations in Santa Barbara, and we filtered out all values that were not restaurants which left us with around 700 lines of data. While the restaurants were not selected in any particular way, we will also be using reviews in our visualization. Reviews are naturally biased, as they are a reflection of an individuals experience, but the hope is that with a high enough quantity of reviews we will be able to get a good idea of the actual quality of the restaurant. However, for restaurants with very few reviews associated with them, we may not be able to accurately assess that restaurants quality. </p>
